            <p>Audi officially unveiled the RS5 premium sports coupe at the 2010 Geneva Auto Show.
                This new model from the German manufacturer features a high-revving 4.2-liter V8 petrol engine with FSI
                direct injection. The model was designed by Audi's quattro division and introduces a newly developed
                crown-gear center differential, that transfers power anywhere from 70 percent front-wheel drive to 85
                percent rear-wheel drive according to driving needs. The RS5 features a luxurious interior that can be
                individually customized to better suit each customer's demands. The sprint from 0 to 100 km/h takes 4.6
                seconds and the average fuel consumption is 10.8 l/100 km (21.7 mpg US). The RS5 is equipped standard
                with Audi's 7-speed S tronic gearbox.

            <p>Seven years after the introduction of the first Audi RS5 coupe, the German automaker introduced a new
                generation for 2018.
                The designers drew inspiration for the RS5 Coupe from the distinctive racing details of the Audi 90 quattro
                IMSA GTO. Massive air inlets with the honeycomb structure typical of RS models characterize the front end
                of the car. The Singleframe radiator grille is much wider and flatter than in the base model. Next to the
                headlights are additional lateral air intakes and outlets; tinted bezels differentiate the optional Matrix LED
                headlights. quattro blisters on the flanks emphasize the pronounced bulges over the wheel arches, which
                have been widened by 15 millimeters (0.6 in). Power comes from a 2.9-liter TFSI V6 bi-turbo engine made
                from the ground up to offer more power, response, and efficiency.</p>
